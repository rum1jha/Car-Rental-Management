Rental Car Management  System

PROBLEM STATEMENT

    With the traditional database system, maintaining and organizing a huge amount of data was a critical task to achieve. Storing and managing the rental car management system datasets in a traditional simple file system may cause chaos in the information management system. To overcome this issue, we will be using a relational database and its features to have a database that doesn’t hold any redundant data and can retrieve desired data efficiently and expeditiously to resolve complex business problems. In this project, we will analyze the rental car management database and will come up with some feasible ideas, and generate reports which will help in upholding the business profit. 

OBJECTIVE

    The purpose of the database is to maintain the inventory, orders, customers details, and transactional payment details. To manage and expand the rental car business and to maximize the profit by attracting more customers, and help in making critical business decisions by analyzing transactional data and usage pattern reports from the database. Using RDBMS, provide knowledge and create reports for the business management team to make accurate, effective, and crucial decisions towards the advancement of the business and to compete in today’s growing market.
